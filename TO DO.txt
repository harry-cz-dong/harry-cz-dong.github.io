----------------------------


Things I've learned:

For horizontal: Use % to make things stretch, Pixel widths for constant elements like icons,
use set margins and widths as variables if you're reusing them a lot  

Throw things into a div and align them, rather than align elements
individually

Use flexboxes to have elements side by side, fill the divs to see placement
