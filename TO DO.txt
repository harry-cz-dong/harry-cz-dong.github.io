Implement sexy project cards, uncomment the tableau
copy-paste it into projects page, DEPLOY!!!



-----------------------------

Post-deployment fixes:
- Insert generative element - probably will just have placeholder for now
- Deal with shrink and mobile layout
- Sexier project flexbox

Future improvements:
- More sophisticated models like XGBoost...I actually had a try with it
but performance was about the same as GLM
- GET BETTER DATA - MORE ENTRIES, DIMENSIONS AND YEARS




- Residual plot as 'diagnosis' for modelling section
- Balance property
- Pick most populous class as baseline?



----------------------------


Things I've learned:

For horizontal: Use % to make things stretch, Pixel widths for constant elements like icons,
use set margins and widths as variables if you're reusing them a lot  

Throw things into a div and align them, rather than align elements
individually

Use flexboxes to have elements side by side, fill the divs to see placement

<li> Gradient boosting: This technique essentially combines the predictions of simple models to form a more powerful model.

		We use the <span class="tech">XGBoost</span> library, which is a handy and popular implementation.</li>
